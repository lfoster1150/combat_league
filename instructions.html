    <p class="instructions-column">Welcome to Combat League, an interpretation of the board game Battleball from 2003. In Combat League two cybernetically enhanced athletes do battle in a futuristic sports arena. The following rules describe how the game plays.</p>
    <p class="instructions-column">(There are also instructions given to the player before every turn, roll, and move back in the main game)</p>
    <p class="instructions-column">- The game consists of two halves that end when a team scores. First team to 2 wins, If both teams are tied at the end of the second half, an overtime period is played to determine the winner</p>
    <p class="instructions-column">- The player starts each turn by picking a game piece corresponding to their team color when prompted. The player rolls and is allowed to move the amount rolled.</p>
    <p class="instructions-column">- If the player moves within a tile adjacent to an opponent a tackle is initiated. The winning player stays on the field, while the loser is injured, leaving a square of debris in which no player can move through.</p>
    <p class="instructions-column">- If a player has the ball and loses a tackle, the ball is fumbled to a random adjacent square. A player simply needs to move through the square containing the ball to pick it up.</p>
